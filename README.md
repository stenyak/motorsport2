Description
-----------

The goal of Motorsport is to become the most realistic simulator of wheeled vehicles. The addition of cars and tracks is a simple task, and most of the simulator features can be easily customized.

Motorsport is licensed under the GNU General Public License, which means that anybody can read its code (and learn from it), and even contribute to it (by adding new features or fixing bugs, for example). There's no proprietary secret formats, so everything (cars, tracks...) can be modified by the community.
